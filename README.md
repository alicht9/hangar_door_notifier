# Hangar Door Notifier
Quick and dirty took for a RasberryPI to send an email to a phone when an airplane hangar's door is activated.

Having to stop a jet, wait for the door to open, then taxi into the hangar burns a lot of fuel. The motivation behind this was have a way to ensure the door is open before getting there.
